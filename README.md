# Ensemble_Learning
In this project my objective is to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit (variable y) . This is a classification problem and I have tried different 
supervised learning algorithms and compared their accuracy , also I have used different ensemble learning models to further improve the accuracy . Wherever possible I have 
extensively used graphs to show the data/comparisons visually .
